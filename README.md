The analysis of thousands of peptides or transcripts in single human cells produces high dimensional data which is difficult to analyze without data transformations that often result in irreversible losses of the original signals.
GlueViz is a program that is largely used for the visualization of astronomical or cartographical data. This lightweight program allows the analysis of millions of individual datapoints while maintaining the original data integrity. 
Proteomic or transcriptomic data can be visualized in GlueViz when the identifiers of each measured protein or transcript in each individual cell is converted to 3 dimensions. The tools and example data provided here demonstrate the application of this approach using publicly available data of single human H-358 cancer cells treated with a KRASG12C covalent inhibitor. The proteomic data is from Orsburn et al., 2022; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.12.480144v1) 
The gif above was recorded within the .glu session provided. 
The singlecell Seq data is from Xue and Zhao et al., 2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7308074/
The gif below was taken from the .glu session uploaded for single cell seq.
